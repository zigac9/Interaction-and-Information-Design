# FRI Ninja

My game is available at [https://fri-ninja.netlify.app/](https://fri-ninja.netlify.app/).
FRI Ninja is a variation of the popular Fruit Ninja game, but with a twist—this time, you’ll be cutting programming languages instead of fruits.
The game is developed using assets from the Faculty of Computer and Information Science at the University of Ljubljana.

#### How to run the project locally:

1. Right click on the index.html file in the VSCODE tab on the left Explorer panel.
2. If you don't have the Live Server extension installed, you can install it from the Extensions view.
3. Select Open Live Server.

## How to Play

1. **Enable Camera**: When the website asks for permission, make sure to enable your camera, as the game uses your hands to interact.
2. **Instructions Toggle**: You can disable the instructions on the site by pressing the letter `I` on your keyboard.

3. **Starting the Game**:

   - To begin, you need to show both of your hands open in front of the camera.
   - On the left side of the screen, you’ll see your score and the programming languages you can cut with your left hand.
   - On the right side, you’ll see your remaining lives and the languages you can cut with your right hand.

4. **Hand Setup**:

   - Your index finger must be extended, and other fingers should be closed for the cut to happen.
   - You can use only one hand to cut at a time, and the last hand you show will be the one used for cutting.

5. **Cutting Languages**:

   - You need to cut the programming languages quickly for more points. The faster you cut, the more points you earn.
   - If you cut too slowly, the language won’t be cut.
   - If you make an error while cutting, you will lost life.

6. **Game Over**:
   - If you lose all lives or make an error, the game will end.
   - To restart, show a thumbs-up with both hands.
